This is a program to calculate the velocity of the International Space Station. 
After our research, we used an Astro Pi to achieve this in conjunction with live satellite imaging and pre-built libraries. 
We also ensured that the capacity of the Astro Pi wasn't reached. The program involved using brute force computation to identify location markers. 
As you might know, the method provided by Raspberry Pi isn't completely accurate. So to filter the noise, we decided to use normal distribution to disregard anomalous readings. 

Overall, we are proud to say that our program has now been selected to be executed on the International Space Station! 
They will run our program for 10 minutes, and send the data captured to us for verification.
